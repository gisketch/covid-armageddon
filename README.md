## 👨‍💻 Development

Developing COVID Armageddon was a grueling task with seemingly insurmountable odds. With just days to go before the deadline, I accepted the challenge of representing the University of Southern Mindanao in the 2021 MCM Youth E-nnovation Summit. As the only one on the team with coding and art experience, I sacrificed countless hours of sleep and worked diligently to bring the game to life - all while juggling my studies during a hectic exam week. 

Against all odds, I managed to make the deadline, and COVID Armageddon was well-received by the contest judges and attendees. The experience of creating this game was truly unforgettable, and it has taught me the value of hard work, perseverance, and dedication. I am proud to have represented my school, and to have created a game that I hope brings joy and excitement to players.
